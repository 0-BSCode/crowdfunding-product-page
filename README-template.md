## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I didn't really dedicate this project to learning anything new as I just wanted to use this challenge as an opportunity to improve on working with React.

### Continued development

I definitely want to improve on organizing my React skills and project files in the future. Although I think they're a lot better in this project than my last one, I definitely think there are still areas that I can get better in. I also want to start developing projects that incorporate back-end technologies like Express JS, Node JS, and MongoDB so that I can advance into full-stack development. Consequently, my next project may be easier on the front-end side since I really want to focus on working on the back-end aspect of the site.

I also want to improve on my CSS skills, specifically when it comes to transitions and animations since I'm not really familiar with those concepts yet.

### Useful resources

- [React Official Site](https://reactjs.org/) - The official docummentation of React has been an extremely useful site for getting my React project up and running.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This is a great website that has saved me a lot of times whenever I get confused on how to use flexbox and grid.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is a great site that has answers to almost any question I can think of when it comes to programming.
